Banks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals.+
There was an increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt.+
A bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice.+
The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.+
Banks face a number of risks in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much capital a bank is required to hold.+
These are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses in accordance with their contractual terms when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level.+
Then debt is reduced and bank capitalization gets a boost. +
The capital requirement is a bank regulation, which sets a framework within which a bank or depository institution must manage its balance sheet.+
They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash.+
if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.+

He was just climbing up the bank with the fat trout in his mouth .0
Little Joe sat down on the bank and prepared to enjoy his breakfast .0
" I was sitting on the bank of the Laughing Brook beside one of the little pools ," he told Billy Mink , " and was just going to eat a fat trout I had caught , when who should come along but that great big bully , Buster Bear .0
His fun began when he surprised Little Joe Otter on the bank of a little pool in the Laughing Brook and Little Joe was so frightened that he dropped a fat trout he had just caught .0
One of them moved now , and quicker than a wink had scooped one of those foolish fish out on to the bank .0
When they came to the place where Buster was waiting , all he had to do was to scoop them out on to the bank .0
Billy Mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish Buster had left on the bank and then he too went down to the Smiling Pool .0
There , on the bank beside the little pool , were the heads of three trout .0
You see when he had found the heads of those trout on the bank he knew right away that some one else had been fishing , and that was why he couldn ' t catch any ; but it didn ' t seem possible that little Billy Mink could have eaten all those trout , and Farmer Brown ' s boy didn ' t once think of Little Joe Otter , and so he was very , very much puzzled .0
He was turning it all over in his mind and studying what it could mean , when he came to a little muddy place on the bank of the Laughing Brook , and there he saw something that made his eyes look as if they would pop right out of his head , and it was right then that he felt his hair rise .0
On the bank on one side of the Smiling Pool were Peter Rabbit , Jumper the Hare , Danny Meadow Mouse , Johnny Chuck , Jimmy Skunk , Unc ' Billy Possum , Striped Chipmunk and Old Mr . Toad .0
When Farmer Brown ' s boy came hurrying home from the Laughing Brook without any fish one day and told about the great footprint he had seen in a muddy place on the bank deep in the Green Forest , and had said his was sure that it was the footprint of a Bear , he had been laughed at .0
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ' and what is the use of a book ,' thought Alice ' without pictures or conversation ?'0
They were indeed a queer - looking party that assembled on the bank -- the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable .0
At this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .0
They were so near to the ball that Lucifer leaned his hand against it , holding the vessel away , as men push a boat off from a bank .0
He suddenly swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane .0
Getting dripping to his feet , with the water up to his knees , the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank .0
It was a sufficiently uninviting one ; nothing so far as could be seen but a steep and shelving bank of shingle , made of loose little pebbles such as children like , but slanting up higher than a house .0
" The third objection ," said Father Brown , still in meditation , " is this bank we are sitting on .0
At the same moment , and long before the vibration had touched the less - experienced English ears , Montano the brigand ran up the bank above them and stood in the broken hedge , steadying himself against a tree and peering down the road .0
Muscari meanwhile , without waiting for support , had crested the bank up to the road , and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder , causing him to stagger and swing round .0
Beyond this mere look of things there was little for Brown ' s freshening fancy to feed on ; he saw no human beings , except some gipsies trailing along the river bank , with faggots and osiers cut in the forest ; and one sight no longer unconventional , but in such remote parts still uncommon : a dark - haired lady , bare - headed , and paddling her own canoe .0
They followed him on to the island , just under the tower , and Father Brown , whether from the mere touch of dry land , or the interest of something on the other bank of the river ( which he stared at very hard for some seconds ), seemed singularly improved in briskness .0
asked Father Brown with a gentle suddenness , pointing to the woods on the left river - bank .0
The other was : " As soon as you get a chance , call out to that canoeing girl ; she ' s over on the bank with the gipsies .0
He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished ; and then refused to linger , though he actually heard young Pendragon , escorted by an enthusiastic crowd , come tramping up the river bank ; and might ( had he been moved by romantic curiosities ) have received the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe .0
Above him , at the angle of the steep green bank of the terraced garden , was one of those small picturesque surprises common in the old landscape gardening ; a kind of small round hill or dome of grass , like a giant mole - hill , ringed and crowned with three concentric fences of roses , and having a sundial in the highest point in the centre .0
The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial ; the next it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American ' s feet , faintly moving one arm .0
But there was a long red stain down the bank from which the man had rolled -- that was no part of the play .0
Gregory gave through the trap the address of an obscure public - house on the Chiswick bank of the river .0
Turning the corner as he spoke , and facing the dim river , flecked with flame , he pointed with his stick to the other bank .0
With a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence , but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St . Eustache , his teeth shining in his thick , black beard , and his bold , brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea .0
On one side of this lawn , alive with dancers , was a sort of green bank , like the terrace in such old - fashioned gardens .0
One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats .0
Accordingly Jem that evening took his stand , with his little basket , upon the bank of the river , just at the place where people land from a ferry - boat , and the walk turns to the wells , and numbers of people perpetually pass to drink the waters .0
Susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow ; her little brothers ran up to the butcher , and demanded whether he was going to DO ANY HARM to the lamb .0
As soon as the attorney was out of sight , Susan rose from the bank where she was seated , came up to her lamb , and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil , to let it eat out of her hand for the last time .0
You have not , I know , yet made up the full sum for your substitute , John Simpson ; therefore do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will find within the ballad .0
He picked up the five guinea bank note , whilst she read , with surprise , " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb ."0
The hat was lodged , at length , upon a bank .0
Hal pursued it : he thought this bank was hard , but , alas !0
They stood on the top of the bank , peeping over the hedge .0
He came up with Tom just as he was climbing the bank into the old man ' s garden .0
Paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat , and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside ; and Anne said she would not meddle with them , and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them ; and Paul said --" If you will stay and watch here , I will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field .0
There goes three thousand dollars , men !-- a bank !-- a whole bank !0
The bank of England !-- Oh , DO , DO , DO !-- What ' s that Yarman about now ?"0
Beneath him with new wonder now he views , To all delight of human sense exposed , In narrow room , Nature ' s whole wealth , yea more , A Heaven on Earth : For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was , by him in the east Of Eden planted ; Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia , built by Grecian kings , Of where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar : In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained ; Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight , smell , taste ; And all amid them stood the tree of life , High eminent , blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold ; and next to life , Our death , the tree of knowledge , grew fast by , Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill . Southward through Eden went a river large , Nor changed his course , but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed ; for God had thrown That mountain as his garden - mould high raised Upon the rapid current , which , through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up - drawn , Rose a fresh fountain , and with many a rill Watered the garden ; thence united fell Down the steep glade , and met the nether flood , Which from his darksome passage now appears , And now , divided into four main streams , Runs diverse , wandering many a famous realm And country , whereof here needs no account ; But rather to tell how , if Art could tell , How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks , Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold , With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar , visiting each plant , and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise , which not nice Art In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill , and dale , and plain , Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field , and where the unpierced shade Imbrowned the noontide bowers : Thus was this place A happy rural seat of various view ; Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm , Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable , Hesperian fables true , If true , here only , and of delicious taste : Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb , were interposed , Or palmy hillock ; or the flowery lap Of some irriguous valley spread her store , Flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose : Another side , umbrageous grots and caves Of cool recess , o ' er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape , and gently creeps Luxuriant ; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills , dispersed , or in a lake , That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned Her crystal mirrour holds , unite their streams .0
Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft , by a fresh fountain side They sat them down ; and , after no more toil Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed To recommend cool Zephyr , and made ease More easy , wholesome thirst and appetite More grateful , to their supper - fruits they fell , Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs Yielded them , side - long as they sat recline On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers : The savoury pulp they chew , and in the rind , Still as they thirsted , scoop the brimming stream ; Nor gentle purpose , nor endearing smiles Wanted , nor youthful dalliance , as beseems Fair couple , linked in happy nuptial league , Alone as they .0
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issued from a cave , and spread Into a liquid plain , then stood unmoved Pure as the expanse of Heaven ; I thither went With unexperienced thought , and laid me down On the green bank , to look into the clear Smooth lake , that to me seemed another sky .0
Thou Sun , said I , fair light , And thou enlightened Earth , so fresh and gay , Ye Hills , and Dales , ye Rivers , Woods , and Plains , And ye that live and move , fair Creatures , tell , Tell , if ye saw , how I came thus , how here ?-- Not of myself ;-- by some great Maker then , In goodness and in power pre - eminent : Tell me , how may I know him , how adore , From whom I have that thus I move and live , And feel that I am happier than I know .-- While thus I called , and strayed I knew not whither , From where I first drew air , and first beheld This happy light ; when , answer none returned , On a green shady bank , profuse of flowers , Pensive I sat me down : There gentle sleep First found me , and with soft oppression seised My droused sense , untroubled , though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible , and forthwith to dissolve : When suddenly stood at my head a dream , Whose inward apparition gently moved My fancy to believe I yet had being , And lived : One came , methought , of shape divine , And said , ' Thy mansion wants thee , Adam ; rise , ' First Man , of men innumerable ordained ' First Father !0
Nearer he drew , and many a walk traversed Of stateliest covert , cedar , pine , or palm ; Then voluble and bold , now hid , now seen , Among thick - woven arborets , and flowers Imbordered on each bank , the hand of Eve : Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned Or of revived Adonis , or renowned Alcinous , host of old Laertes ' son ; Or that , not mystick , where the sapient king Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse .0
Her hand he seised ; and to a shady bank , Thick over - head with verdant roof imbowered , He led her nothing loth ; flowers were the couch , Pansies , and violets , and asphodel , And hyacinth ; Earth ' s freshest softest lap .0
The atmosphere is not a perfume , it has no taste of the distillation , it is odorless , It is for my mouth forever , I am in love with it , I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked , I am mad for it to be in contact with me .0

BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates .0
Mueller , a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria , noted that the Bundesbank ' s decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting .0
" Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates , especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad , rather than growth in bank credits , is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non - banks ," Mueller said .0
A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock , the Bundesbank ' s main money supply indicator .0
The less dependent non - banks are on bank credits , the harder it is to steer money supply .0
The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth , pointing to the success of the current policy , he said .0

Although Volcker ' s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar , many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today ' s data , which covered the two - week bank statement period ended yesterday .0

Merchant bank Pierson , Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct .0
Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder .0
Some analysts also question the central bank ' s decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge .0
Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market , noting " the ( 4 . 5 pct ) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates ."0
Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate , and interest rate policies serve that goal .0
